            <strong>End User: </strong>Female college students between their 1st and 3rd years who are majoring in
            engineering or technical science. Students tend to be busy or try to multi-task so the website will need
            to be simple, eye-catching and quick to go through while easily providing more information for those who
            are very interested.
            <br/><br/>
            Most sorority/fraternity websites don't follow usability principles which result in sites that are overwhelmed
            with text and content without really conveying key points the client wants to make. AOE wants their users
            to know both the professional and social benefits for joining the sorority.
            <br/><br/>
            They also want the to display
            their social media and on-campus presence by showcasing the events that they run and participate in. They
            want to have a page to see all the sisters, their Greek class, and other links to social links and professional
            contact (LinkedIn / Resumes)
            <br/><br/>
            Ultimately they want to highlight and emphasize all of the positives of joining AOE to entice recruits
