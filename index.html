              <p><strong>Project Description: </strong>Building an interactive website for AOE (Alpha Omega Epsilon Sorority).
                In the past, AOE has tried to make their own websites, but their previous iterations are generic and clunky.
                They want a website that will really allow them to impress their peers and potential recruits.  </p>

                is targeted towards potential recruits of AOE. The website will showcase information about the sorority and
                their values as well as testimonials from sisters and benefits to joining.</p>
